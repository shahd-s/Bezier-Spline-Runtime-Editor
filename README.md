# Bezier-Spline-Runtime-Editor 

This is a tool that I have created that allows you to create and edit cubic or quadtratic Bezier curves at runtime in Unity. It uses a LineRenderer and draws several conjoined Bezier segments upon mouse click. It gives you two (cubic), or one (quadtratic), control points (that I have generated by considering the two end points of a segment to make up an equaliatiral triangle, of which the two control points are the third vertex), which you can drag around to alter the corresponding Bezier segment. Currently, the choice of segments to be cubic or quadratic is determined by the boolean variable "cubic". In the future, I may add this as an editor feature.
